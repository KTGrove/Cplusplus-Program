# Cplusplus-Program

#Project Summary
In doing this project I created a banking system that allows people to calculate interest earned in a savings account based on initial deposit, additional monthly deposits if applicable, the interest rate, and the length of time the money was in the account.

#What was done particularly well?
What I feel I did particularly well was formatting the display of the menus to the user. 

#Where could you enhance your code?
I could enhance this code by using functions that allow me to call to them rather than re-writing the same code multiple times to display the input. 

#Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging?
I did find it challenging to correctly align the variables output to the screen. For whatever reason I tried several different codes to format the numbers correctly and took me what felt like too many tries to finally get the display correct. I could aling the variables correctly in the display for monthly interest earned but had issues getting the display to align correctly in the annual interest earned display box. The tools/resources I used most, outside of the textbook, were C++ reddit threads, stackoverflow, and YouTube. I tend to learn better when I can see how the process is completed.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferrable to other projects or coursework?
Using the code, regardless of what it's being used to create, allows for better understanding of syntax, functions, loops etc. This really will just improve my understanding of how to utilize C++ overall for future projects outside of this class and again hopefully when I get into the workforce, of course depending on the preferred language with my future employer.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This program was created with the intention to display the accumulation of funds over a period of time. The algorithms used to calculate the accrual of funds work regardless of what variables the user may input. This allows for a wider range of usability in calculating various amounts of funds over varying periods of time. The different displays allow the user to easily read what was calculated based on their input. For maintainability, the code should be quite easy to maintain. If changed were to be made in the display or calculations one could easily change few variables to produce a new code.
